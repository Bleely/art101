			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocode and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab ask us to create psuedocode of an everyday task and input that into 
						our html for lab4, and to create psuedocode for a simple game in the style 
						of Javascript comments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My Psuedocode for sudoku was indented really far into my Results
						section for some reason and I haven't been able to fix it. I was 
						able to fix it for my computer in the CSS, but even then I wasn't sure why it 
				        would have indented like that in the first place.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I had less time for this assignment than I have had for others, but I still tried
						to aproach it with as much energy as possible. I would still like to know why 
						my sudoku psuedocode was not aligned in the way I wanted it to be. 
					</p>
			</div>
