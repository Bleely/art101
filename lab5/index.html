					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This text asked us to play with Javascript. Specifically, it asked us to experiement with variables
						in Javascript.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I intially had trouble getting my Javascript to connect to my html, but I realized that this was 
						because my Javascript link still had the command 'DEFER' and once I removed that the 
						output worked properly. The other problem I had was with the image I included. For a while
					    it wouldn't load and I wasn't sure if this was because the image just took time to upload, or 
					    if this problem emerged because the image took the form of a png instead of a jpeg. I exported
					    the image to change it into a jpeg, and changed it's size to make it smaller in CSS, but it still
					    didn't load. I finally realized it was a problem with how I linked the image in the html, so I 
					    fixed that and it worked perfectly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went well. I haven't used Javascript before, but it
						was broken down in a way that made it quite comprehendable. </p>
