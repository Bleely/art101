					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab asked us to create a wepage that said Hello World and included some information about 
						both partners working on the project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> There were a couple small problems that arose. We had some trouble uploading an image,
						but once we figured that the CSS was smooth sailing. The other issue we had was adding a 
					link to our home webpages, but we explained more about this problem in our summary of efforts. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment went well. It was fun to try and figure out how to style the webpage. It was also fun to 
						pick out each stylistic element. Such as, font family, color, images included, etc. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We created what I think is a cool looking webpage.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
