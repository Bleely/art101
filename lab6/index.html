			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab asked us to use arrays and objects in Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have any problems but I did have to play around with 
						the Javascript so that words would appear as I wanted them to. I also 
					    at one point had a typo in my Javascript that disenabled the object from 
					    appearing, but once I fixed that everything worked as expected. I also 
					    realized that in my past labs I had incorrectly linked the main page so 
					    I went back through the lecture on referencing files and fixed that.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment went well I put the same energy into it as 
						I did into others.  </p>
